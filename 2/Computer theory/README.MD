### 🛠️ Tools: 
- **cmd.py** :
Automate the process of testing the functionality of a program. It systematically executes the program using a set of predefined test cases and compares the program's output against expected results. The main goal of the script is to validate whether program performs as expected for each test case, aiding in debugging and quality assurance processes.
