# 🎓 Queuing System Simulation

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is focused on developing a queuing system simulation based on Kendall's notation, commonly represented with four parameters: inter-arrival time distribution, service time distribution, number of servers, and queue capacity. The primary goal is to study the distribution of the number of people in the system at a given time \(t\), as well as to explore other probabilities depending on the chosen parameters.

The simulation emphasizes the M/M/s/m queuing models and aims to explain fundamental concepts from queuing theory. It includes an application that allows users to input necessary parameters and then simulates random arrivals and service times, displaying the system state over time.

### 🛠 Key Features

- **📝 Parameter Input**: Users can input the four key parameters of the queuing model.
- **🔄 Real-time Simulation**: Simulate and visualize the queue dynamics as random events (arrivals and services) occur.
- **🔍 State Monitoring**: Observe changes in the queue state dependent on time and input parameters.

### 🏥 Practical Application

The simulation includes a specific case study focused on a healthcare delivery system, modeling random patient arrivals at a hospital. This case study helps to illustrate how queuing theory can be applied to real-world scenarios, particularly in managing fluctuating service demands in medical facilities.
