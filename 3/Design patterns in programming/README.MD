### ðŸ”¬ Lab Experiments (ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·)
1. **Dynamic Polymorphism in C and C++**: Dive into the concepts of dynamic polymorphism. Experiment with virtual functions and class hierarchies in C++ and compare them with C's approach to achieving similar functionality.
2. **Strategy and Observer Patterns**: Learn and implement these fundamental design patterns. The Strategy pattern will help you understand how to encapsulate varying algorithms, while the Observer pattern will enable you to manage and notify state changes in your software design.
3. **Building Factories and Editors from Scratch**: Create your own factory methods to generate objects dynamically, and develop a simple text editor application, focusing on design patterns and practical application development.
4. **Vector Graphics Programming**: Develop a program that handles vector graphics, focusing on implementing features such as drawing, scaling, and rotating geometric shapes. Explore the principles of graphic design software architecture.
