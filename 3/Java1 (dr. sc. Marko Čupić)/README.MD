### ðŸ“˜ Lectures (ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·)
This course is designed to be highly interactive and requires active participation in live lectures. Success in this course depends on careful listening and engaging with the professor during these sessions. Additionally, students must complete multiple assignments to prepare for exams and adequately demonstrate their understanding of the material.

### ðŸ”¬ Lab Experiments (ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·)
The laboratory component of this course emphasizes hands-on learning through a series of progressively complex programming tasks:

1. **Object Class Implementation from Scratch**: Begin by building a basic object class to understand object-oriented programming fundamentals.
2. **Collection Class Implementation & HTML Parser**: Use the object class created in the previous experiment to implement a collection class, exploring data structures, HTML parser will be used in Java2
3. **Generalizing Collections**: Expand on the previous collection class to increase its generality and utility in programming.
4. **Creating a Simple Database with Queries**: Utilize the collections from previous tasks to design a simple database capable of handling basic queries.
5. **Encrypting and Decrypting Files & Terminal Creation**: Learn to secure data through encryption and decryption and develop a functional command-line terminal.
6. **Parallelizing Complex Tasks (GUI)**: Apply parallel computing concepts to perform resource-intensive calculations, such as rendering the Mandelbrot fractal, in a graphical user interface.
7. **Advanced Calculator with Programming Design Patterns (GUI)**: Develop a sophisticated calculator that incorporates various programming design patterns and functions like sine, cosine, exponential, and their inverses, complete with a memory stack (push, pop, reset) within a GUI.
8. **Feature-rich Notepad (GUI)**: Create an advanced text editor with support for multiple programming design patterns, localization, multitab management, file saving, text manipulation, keyboard shortcuts, and responsive design.

These lab experiments are structured to build on one another, enhancing students' programming skills and preparing them for complex software development challenges.
