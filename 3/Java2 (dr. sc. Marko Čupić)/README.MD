### ðŸ“˜ Lectures (ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·)
This course is designed to be highly interactive and requires active participation in live lectures. Success in this course depends on careful listening and engaging with the professor during these sessions. Additionally, students must complete multiple assignments to prepare for exams and adequately demonstrate their understanding of the material.

### ðŸ”¬ Lab Experiments (ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·)

The laboratory component of this course offers an intensive, hands-on experience through a sequence of complex programming tasks. Each lab builds upon previous assignments to not only solidify technical knowledge but also to encourage the application of these skills in scenarios that mimic real-world challenges:

1. **Enhanced Parallelism and Real-Time Communication**:
   - **1.a Enhanced Parallelism**: Enhance the parallelism techniques explored in "JAVA1 6th homework" by integrating a thread pool and pool manager to boost application performance and efficiency.
   - **1.b Multi-Client Chat Application**: Develop a robust multi-client chat application using client and server architectures. This application will manage standard messaging protocols such as "HELLO", "ACK", "BYE", "OUTMSG", and "INMSG", providing a realistic environment for real-time communication.

2. **HTTP Server Development**: Construct an HTTP server that facilitates session management. Employ a custom parser, previously developed, to generate HTML using a simplified scripting syntax reminiscent of JavaScript. This project aims to deepen your understanding of the HTTP request lifecycle and effective file management.

3. **Voting Web Application**: Create a voting web application employing Java Server Pages (JSP) and incorporating third-party dependencies and JARs for handling specific data formats. This application introduces you to the complexities of integrating external software components.

4. **Advanced Voting Web Application with JDBC**: Upgrade your basic voting web application by incorporating Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). This enhancement focuses on improving database interactions and data management within the application.

5. **JPA Blog Web Application**: Develop a sophisticated blog web application using Java Persistence API (JPA), connected to a PostgreSQL database. The application features user login functionality and implements security protocols to control content visibility based on user roles.

These lab experiments are carefully crafted to progressively enhance your technical prowess, transitioning from foundational programming techniques to the development of advanced networked and web-based applications.
