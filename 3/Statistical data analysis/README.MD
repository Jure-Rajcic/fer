## 👥 Project: UFC Fight Analysis

### Motivation and Problem Description
The analysis of sports events, including games, matches, and fights, deeply influences every sector of the sports industry—ranging from management and training to sponsorship, marketing, and sports forecasting. This project focuses on the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where detailed fight data have been systematically collected for extensive analysis.

### Dataset Description and Project Guidelines
This dataset features comprehensive details on UFC fights and the athletes involved, spanning from 1993 to 2021. It includes metrics such as fight duration in rounds, referee details, and the event's date and location. Fighter-specific attributes include height, weight, arm reach, and fighting stance. Critical outcomes like the fight winner and the method of victory (e.g., knockout) are also recorded.

### Research Questions to Guide the Project:
- 🥊 Can we predict the likelihood of a fight ending in a knockout based on the differences in arm reach between the fighters?
- ⏳ Does the duration of matches (in seconds) vary among different weight categories?
- 🏆 Are title fights generally longer (in terms of rounds) than non-title fights?
- 🏅 Can we use the available data to predict the winner of a fight effectively?

Feel encouraged to develop your own research questions and hypotheses using the available data to further explore this intriguing field.
