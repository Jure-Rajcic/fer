## ðŸ‘¥ Project: Group Fitness Planner

### Background
As a big enthusiast of a healthy lifestyle, which necessarily includes regular physical activity, you prefer exercising in a group setting at your local gym with sessions led by a professional trainer. Typically, you arrange workout plans directly with your trainer and receive a fixed scheduleâ€”every other day at the same time. However, due to a hectic daily routine, you often find it challenging to attend every session, leading to frustration over paid but unattended sessions and a disrupted workout plan.

### Solution
To address this issue, we developed the **Group Fitness Planner** app. This full-stack application allows you to customize your workout schedule according to your availability, aligning it seamlessly with your personal fitness goals. It ensures that you can make the most out of your investments in health and fitness by adjusting your training times as needed.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Additional Technologies**: Docker, Selenium for automated testing, and unit testing to ensure robust application performance.

### Features
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Adjust your workout sessions based on personal availability.
- **Direct Communication**: Interact directly with your trainer within the app to modify your fitness plan.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your daily routine, enhancing your ability to maintain a healthy lifestyle without compromising on your busy schedule.

This project not only caters to fitness enthusiasts who face similar challenges but also leverages modern software engineering techniques to create a user-friendly, adaptable, and reliable fitness planning tool.
